            <h3><b>Overview</b></h3>
            <p>
              For this assignment I created a schematic for three LEDs that are connected to my arduino.
              Then I implemented the circuit on a breadboard to create three independent blinking lights.

            <p>Note: Kay Waller helped me with a few HTML/CSS hurdles and we discussed the
              different resistances based on voltage drops.</p>

            <h3><b>Schematic</b></h3>

            <br>
            <p>
              To understand how I was going to get my LEDs to independently light up I sketched a schematic.
              Because I wanted them to blink independently, I started each LED from a different pin (13, 12, 11) that's on the Arduino board.
              First, I knew that I wanted to run my LEDs at around 20 mA current. Using Ohm's Law (V = I * R) I calculated the resistances that I needed
              for my circuit.
            </p>

            <p>
              I found two different resistances. One needed for both the Green/Red LEDs and one for the White LED, because the
              White LED has a different voltage drop than the Green and Red LEDs.
            </p>

            <p>
              I started with Ohm's law: <b>V = I * R</b>
            </p>

            <p> To find resistance (R) based on our two givens, voltage (V) and current (I),
              I rearranged the equation to be: <br>
              <b>R = V/ I</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              <u>For the Red and Green LEDs:</u> <br>
              The voltage source, my computer, was <b>5 V</b> <br>
              The voltage drop for Red and Green is <b>1.8 V</b> <br>
              I want the current to be 20 mA, which is <b>0.02 A</b> <br>
              And I want to find the needed resistance, <b>R Ω</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              Plugging in those values to the equation I get:<br>
              <b>5V - 1.8V = 0.02A * RΩ</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              Then I solved for R (Ω)<br>
              <b>3.2V / 0.02A = RΩ</b> <br>
              <b>160Ω = R</b> <br>
            </p>

            <p>
              For the Red/Green LEDs, I found that to have a current of <b>20mA</b> and a voltage of <b>3.2V</b> I needed <b>160Ω</b> for resistance.
              The closest resistor in my kit was the <b>220Ω</b> resistor; this is what I used for my circuit. <br>
              With the <b>220Ω</b> and voltage of <b>3.2V</b> <br>
              <b>I = V / R</b> <br>
              <b>I = 3.2V / 220Ω</b> <br>
              <b>I = 0.0145A</b> <br>
              It's okay that the current is slightly lower than the 0.02A preffered. <br>
            </p>

            <p>
              <u>For the White LED:</u> <br>
              The voltage source, my computer, was <b>5 V</b> <br>
              The voltage drop for White is <b>3.3 V</b> <br>
              I want the current to be 20 mA, which is <b>0.02 A</b> <br>
              And I want to find the needed resistance, <b>RΩ</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              Plugging in those values to the equation I get:<br>
              <b>5V - 3.3V = 0.02A * RΩ</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              Then I solved for R (Ω)<br>
              <b>1.7V / 0.02A = RΩ</b> <br>
              <b>85Ω = R</b> <br>
            </p>

            <p>
              For the White LED, I found that to have a current of <b>20mA</b> and a voltage of <b>1.7V</b> I needed <b>85Ω</b> for resistance.
              The closest resistor in my kit was the <b>100Ω</b> resistor; this is what I used for my circuit.<br>
              With the <b>100Ω</b> and voltage of <b>1.7V</b> <br>
              <b>I = V / R</b> <br>
              <b>I = 1.7V / 100Ω</b> <br>
              <b>I = 0.017A</b> <br>
              It's okay that the current is slightly lower than the 0.02A preffered. <br>
            </p>

            <h3><b>Arduino Code </b></h3>
            <p>
              To get the lights to blink independently I coded the Arduino. I found inspiration from the example code snippet, "Blink." <br></br>

              For the setup() I initated the three different pins on the Arduino (13, 12, 11). <br></br>

              The loop() is where the LED lights actually light up and blink. Because I set each LED light to a different pin on the Arduino board,
              I had control over each light. I decided to make the green light blink twice in a row quickly, and then have the white light blink once,
              and then have the red light blink once; then repeat until "forever.
