            <h3><b>Overview</b></h3>
            <p>
              For this assignment I created a schematic to visualize the circuit for a button and two LEDs that are
              connected to my arduino. Then I implemented the circuit on a breadboard. <br></br>
              When the button is pressed the green LED will fade to dimmer
              and then will dim to brighter; then both lights will blink simultaneously 7 times. When the button is not pressed,
              the green LED will be on while the yellow LED blinks.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>
              To understand how to set up my circuit on my arduino board I sketched out a schematic and did the calculations
              for the needed resistors for the button and LEDs. I wanted my two LEDs to turn on/off independently and have the button
              control their behavior. Because I was going to use analogWrite() to give specific brightness values to my LEDs,
              I hooked up my green LED to pin ~6 and my yellow LED
              to pin ~5 on the arduino board. Then I connected my button to the 5V, and had pin 2 connect after the button to allow
              me to read the button's value (digitalRead()) of high/low.
            </p>

            <p>
              First, I wanted to find the resistor needed for the button circuit. I used Ohm's law to calculate the resistance.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ohm's Law: <b>V = I * R</b> <br>
              The voltage source, my computer,<b> was 5V </b> <br>
              The arduino supplies a max current of <b>40 mA</b> <br>
              And I want to find the needed resistance, <b>RΩ</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              Plug those values into the equation: <br>
              <b>5V = 0.04A * RΩ</b> <br>
              <b>5V / 0.04A = RΩ</b> </br>
              <b> R = 125Ω</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              I don't have a 125Ω resistor in my kit; I have a 100Ω and a 220Ω. The <b>100Ω</b> resistor is too small
              and will create too large of a current. <br>
              <b>V = I * R</b> <br>
              <b>V / R = I</b> <br>
              <b>5V / 100Ω = I</b> <br>
              <b>I = 50mA</b> <br></br>

              So, I used the 220Ω, which creates a 22.7mA current <br>
              <b>I = V / R </b> <br>
              <b>I = 5V / 220Ω </b> <br>
              <b>I = 22.7mA </b> <br>
            </p>

            <p>
              Then, I calculated the needed resistance for the LED circuits. I was using a yellow LED and green LED;
              they both have a voltage drop of 1.8V, so I can use the same size resistor.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ohm's Law: <b>V = I * R</b> <br>
              The voltage source, my computer, was <b>5V</b> <br>
              The voltage drop was <b>1.8V</b> <br>
              The desired current was <b>20mA</b> <br>
              and I want to find the resistance <b>RΩ</b> <br>
            </p>

            <p>
              Plug those values into the equation: <br>
              <b>5V - 1.3V = 0.02A * RΩ</b> <br>
              <b>3.2V / 0.02A = RΩ</b> </br>
              <b> R = 160Ω</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              For the yellow and green LEDs I found that to have <b>20mA</b> of current and a voltage of <b>3.2V</b>
              I need a <b>160Ω</b> resistor. The closest resistor in my kit is the 220Ω resistor; this is what I used in my
              circuits.<br>

              With the <b>220Ω</b> and voltage of <b>3.2V</b> <br>
              <b>I = V / R</b> <br>
              <b>I = 3.2V / 220Ω</b> <br>
              <b>I = 0.0145A</b> <br>
              It's okay that the current is slightly lower than the 0.02A preffered. The current just
              can't be above 30mA according to the documentation.
            </p>

            <h3><b>Arduino Code </b></h3>
            <p>
              To get the button to change the state of the LED lights I coded the Arduino.
              I found inspiration from the example code snippet, "Button." <br></br>

              First I set up my constants, which were the pin numbers for the LEDs and button. <br></br>

              For the setup() I initialized the two LED lights (green and yellow) to their respective pins (which I had just put as constants)
              on the Arduino (~6, ~5); I also initialized the pin for the button as input as I want to read if it's on or off. <br></br>

              The loop() is where the fun happens! It constanly loops and reads and checks if the button is pressed.
              If the button is not pressed, then the green light is on full brightness and the yellow light blinks on and off.
              It reminds me of a play on caution traffic lights. The yellow is blinking communicating being careful.

              If the button is pressed the yellow light shuts off, and the green light fades from bright to dim and then
              fades from dim to bright. Then the green and yellow light blink together 7 times.
