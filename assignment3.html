            <h3><b>Overview</b></h3>
            <p>
              For this assignment I created a schematic to visualize the circuit for a photoresistor (sensor that senses light)
              and an RGB LED that are connected to my arduino. Then I implemented the circuit on a breadboard. <br></br>

              When there is a lot of light in the room, such as a flashlight, the LED turns a light blue. When it's medium brightness, such as
              normal overhead lights in a room, the LED will be a bright red. When there is no light, the LED turns green.
            </p>

              Note: Kay Waller helped me talk through and understand what is happening with a voltage drop and the importance of Vout.
              Also, Nadya and Jasper (through Slack) helped a ton in understanding the importance of choosing a correct R2.

            <p>
              To understand how to set up my circuit on my arduino board I sketched out a schematic and did the calculations
              for the resistor needed for the voltage divider and the resistors needed for the RBG LED. I wanted my RGB
              LED to turn different colors based on the amount of light in the room that the photoresistor would detect.

              <br></br>

              The RGB LED consists of a red, green, and blue LED that each have their own resistor (see calculations below).
              Because I was going to use analogWrite() to give specific brightness values to each red/green/blue LED I hooked up
              my red LED to pin ~9, green LED to ~10, and blue LED to ~11. The ~ allows me to use analogWrite.
              Then I want to use analogRead on the voltage divide (R1 = photoresistor and R2 = 2k resistor) so I hooked
              A0 to read the V_out from the voltage divider.

              In summary, I needed to find the best resistor value for R2 that goes with my photoresistor (R2).
              First, I tested the lowest and highest resistance of the photoresistor with my multimeter.
              When I shined a bright flashlight on the photoresistor I measured 130Ω. Then when I turned off all the lights
              and put a black paper infront of the photoresistor I measured 115kΩ. So, my min photoresistor resistance value is <b>130Ω</b>
              and my max photoresistor resistance value is <b>115kΩ.</b> Then I knew that I wanted two things. First, I wanted an R2 that would
              give me the largest range of V_out values (because AnalogRead gives reads 0 (0V) to 1023 (5V)) and I want that full range of voltage.
              Second, I need R2 to not allow too much current flow from power to ground. I used the V_out equation to calculate the V_out range
              for resistances of 100Ω, 220Ω, 2kΩ, 10kΩ, and 100kΩ, and then chose the resistor that gave me the largest V_out range.
              I found that <b>2k resistor would be best for R2</b> because it gives the largest range of V_out values and not allow too much current.

            <h3><b>Arduino Code </b></h3>
            <p>
              To get the amount of light to change the color of the RGB LED I coded the Arduino.
              I found inspiration from the example code snippet, "AnalogInOutSerial" and from class slides. <br></br>

              First I set up my constants, which were the pin numbers for the LEDs and photoresistor.
              And the initial values for the photoresistor's sensor value (which is between 0-1023)
              and the sensor value after it's been remapped.<br></br>

              For the setup() I initialized the serial number so that I could monitor the sensor values. Then I
              initialized the photoresistor as an input to its respective pin A0.
              I also initialized the three LEDs (red, green, blue) as outputs and mapped them to pin numbers ~9, ~10, ~11. <br></br>

              The loop() is where the action happens! It constanly loops and reads and checks what
              value the photoresistor reads (on a scale of very bright to very dark); The analogRead reads 1023 for 5V
              and 0 for 0V. Note that dark is lower voltage and brighter is higher voltage. Then once I attain that 0-1023
              value, I remap it to a different range; I chose 0 - 255 in case I wanted to directly feed the changedValue to
              the analogWrite() for the LEDs; I chose to go a different course though. Based on my brightness tests (that I
              used the serial.print() to test) a flashlight yields a value around 980 and covering the photoresistor with my finger
              yields a value around 240. Then I remapped those low and high values to the scale of 0-255 with the map() function. <br></br>

              I have an if/else if/else statement that splits the sensor values into three categories: bright, semi-bright, dark.
              I chose values based on my light tests with my finger, regular room light, and flashlight.
              My initial goal was to make a sunset. Bright lights would cause the LED to be bright blue like the sky. Then medium dark
              the LED would be a pink, and really dark would be orange/yellow. I did get this to work, but the colors didn't look different
              when I videotaped it. So, I had to change the colors to more distinct colors. When it's bright, the LED is blue. When it's
              semi-bright, the LED is red. And when it's dark the LED is green.
