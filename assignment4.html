            <h3><b>Overview</b></h3>
            <p>
              For this assignment I created a schematic and circuit that uses an  N-MOSFET transistor to control
              load power separate from logic power. I also used a Infrared Sensor to detect
              communication from the remote that controlls an LED strip. This project also uses an external power
              supply (the wall outlet), which gives higher voltage to light up the LED strip.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note: I talked with Kay and Lily to better understand the calculations for the current
              going through the transistor.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h3><b>Schematic</b></h3>
            <br>
            <center><img src="Photos/A4/schematic.jpg" width=500></a></center>
            <br>
            <p>
              Transistors are new to me so I sketched out a schematic of my circuit and calculated the
              current that would go through my transistor. Because I was using a new, larger power source (12V from the wall)
              I wanted to make sure that I didn't break anything. <br></br>

              I have a larger power source of 12V that is connected to the LED strip (which is our load). Then
              I have my N-MOSFET transistor. The D pin of the transistor is connected to the LED strip, the S
              pin is connected to ground, and the G pin is connected to pin ~10. It is connected to pin 10 because it
              has the ~ so I can use analogWrite() to communicate with the transistor through my code. The other part
              of my schematic is for the Infrared sensor. The sensor gets voltage from the 5V pin, which is connected to R.
              It then travels to ground, connected to G. Between 5V and ground, pin ~9 is connected to Y and reads input. <br></br>

              Next, I needed to make sure that the current flowing through the transistor is not more than 32A (that is the
              maximum amount of current our transistors can handle). So, I needed to calculate the amount of current
              flowing through my transistor based on my LED strip. <br></br>

              The box the LED Strip came in says we have <b>300 LEDS</b>. Each LED section contains <b>3 white LEDs and
              one resistor</b>. <br></br>

              Since there are 300 LEDs total there are <b>100 sections</b> (300LEDs/3LEDs per section).<br></br>

              Looking at just one section; I found the current: <br>
              Each white LED has a <b>3.6 voltage drop</b>. <br>
              There are 3 white LEDs so <b>3V * 3.6V = 10.8 voltage drop</b><br>
              The resistor is a <b>181Ω</b><br>
              And the starting voltage is <b>12V</b><br>
              Using <b>V = IR</b><br>
              <b>12v - 10.8v = I * 181Ω</b><br>
              <b>1.2V / 181Ω = I</b><br>
              <b>1.2V / 181Ω = 0.0066A</b><br></br>

              Since all of the LED sections are in parallel, to get the total current of the whole LED strip, I just
              add up all of the currents.<br>
              There are 100 sections so <b>0.0066A * 100sections = 0.66A total</b><br></br>

              The LED strip draws 0.66A. This is way less than 32A the transistor can support.<br></br>

              I wanted to double check my answer using a different method. <br>
              I first calcualted the total resistance of the LED strip. All of the LED sections are in parallel.
              So, the total resistance is <b>1/R = 1/181Ω * 100 sections</b>. This equals a total resistance of <b>1.81Ω.</b><br>

              Then I did <b>V(total) = I(total) + R(total)</b>, which is <b>12V - 10.8V = I(total) * 1.81Ω</b><br>
              so <b>1.2V / 1.81Ω = I(total)</b><br>
              <b>I(total) = 0.66A</b><br></br>
              This aligns with the calculation I got above, so I knew that the transistor would be able to handle
              the amount of current the LED strip draws.

              The LED strip starts turned off. Then pressing the 1 button on the remote the LED strip
              turns on. By pressing the 3 button it turns off. The 2 button makes the LED strip flash
              5 times. The + button causes the LED strip to fade from off to on, and the - button
              causes the LED strip to fade from on to off.

            <h3><b>Arduino Code </b></h3>
            <p>
              To get the IR remote to controll the behavior of the LED Strip I coded the Arduino.
              I found inspiration from the example code snippet from this <a href='http://www.circuitbasics.com/arduino-ir-remote-receiver-tutorial/
              '>circuit basics page.</a><br></br>

              First I imported the library IRemote for the IR sensor and remote. I then set up my two contanst for
              the IR sensor and transistor pin. The Transistor's pin is ~10 because I need to be able to
              use AnalogWrite() and the ~ allows me to do this. Then I create an object of type IRrecv and
              a decode_results variable to store the data from the sensor. <br></br>

              The setup() initializes serial communications so I can see the sensor's values in order to debug and
              better understand what my code is doing. Then I set up my IR sensor and tell the arduino to blink
              when a signal from the remote is received; this helped me when I was debugging my code. Finally, I set up my
              transistor pin as an output so I could give it directions to open or close the voltage. By stating that it's
              an output, the state of the pin is initially LOW.  <br></br>

              The loop() constantly runs and listens for a signal from the IR remote. It first checks to see if the IR
              sensor is getting any signal. Then I have multiple if statements checking if a certain button on the remote is
              pressed. If 1 is pressed, the LED strip will turn ON because I tell the transistor pin, through the analogWrite(),
              to turn on the voltage. The ON corresponds to the 255 because it's a 100% on duty cycle. If 3 is pressed, the
              LED strip will turn OFF because I tell the transistor pin, through the analogWrite(), to turn voltage OFF. The
              OFF corresponds to the 0 because I have a 0% on duty cycle. If 2 is pressed, the LED strip will flash 5 times.
              I did this with a for loop and turning the transistor ON and OFF because our transistor acts like a switch
              (the gate is open or closed).
              If you press the + button, the LED strip will fade from dark to light, and if you press the - button it will
              fade from light to dark. I faded the LED strip with a for-loop and changing the value I give to the analogWrite(), thus
              changing the duty cycle and brightness of the LED lights.
