            <h3><b>Overview</b></h3>
            <p>
              For this assignment I created a webpage with p5.js that interacts with
              my sensor data coming from my arduino over serial, and vice versa; interacting with computer keyboards
              will directly affect an LED light on the arduino board. I chose to make a panda on
              the webpage to make it interactive. I used a thermoresistor and button as my two sensors
              that control the colors of the panda.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h3><b>Schematic</b></h3>
            <br>
            <center><img src="Photos/A6/schematic.jpg" width=600></a></center>
            <br>
            <p>
              I created a schematic for this project in order to grasp what circuit I was going to make. I calculated the
              values of the resistors needed for the voltage divide, button, and blue LED.
              I wanted my button and thermoresistor to interact with my web page I created
              and change the colors of my panda on the web page. Then I wanted the `1` and `2` keys on a keyboard
              to turn on and off the LED.
            </p>

            <p>
              I connected my button to the 5V and had pin 2 connect after the button to allow me to read the
              button's value of ON (1) or OFF (0). I did this with digitalRead() so I could use pin 2; I also used a 220Ω resistor.
              Then, I created a voltage divide with the thermoresistor and another resistor, which I chose to be 10kΩ.
              I connected the A0 pin between the thermoresistor and 10kΩ resistor so I could read the V_out value,
              and A0 allows me to use analogRead(). I used a 100Ω resistor with the blue LED to make sure that the right amount of
              current would flow through the LED. The blue LED is connected to pin 7 because all I do is write digitalWrite(HIGH or LOW) to turn
              the LED on or off.
              My calculations for my chosen resistors are below:

            <br>

            <p>
              In summary, I needed the find the best resistor for R2 that would create a voltage divide with the thermoresistor.
              I needed an R2 that would give me the largest range of V_out values. First, I tested the highest and lowest resistance
              of my thermoresistor with my multimeter. When I put an ice cube on it, the resistance was <b>25kΩ</b> and when I put
              my hand on it, the resistance was <b>9kΩ.</b> My R1 range was <b>9kΩ - 25kΩ.</b> I know that
              the thermoresistor can have lower/higher resistance values, but it's hard for me to get it warmer than my own body temperature.
              Then, I wanted two things. First, I needed an resistor that would give me the largest V_out range with the thermoresistor.
              Second, I needed R2 to not allow too much current flow from power to ground. I used the V_out equation to calculate the V_out
              range with R2 being 100Ω, 220Ω, 2kΩ, 10kΩ, and 100kΩ, and then chose the resistor with the largest V_out range.
              I found that the <b>10kΩ resistor would be the best</b> because the V_out range, which was 1.2V, was the highest. It also
              doesn't allow too much current; <b>0.26mA</b> is way less than the max current of 40mA that the arduino pin can supply.

            </p>

            <center><i><p>I used Matlab to quickly calculate V_out ranges for each resistor in order to see variance</i></p></center>
            <br>

            <p>Finally, I calculated the antipicated values I was going to read from analogRead(A0). First,
              analogRead() gives values between 0 - 2023; 0 corresponds to 0V and 1023 corresponds to 5V.
              Then from the calculations above, I knew the V_out values I was going to get at the end points (highest and lowest resistance)
              with the 10kΩ resistor. After calculationg, I anticipated that I would get an <b>analogRead() range of about 292 - 538</b>.
              It would be 292 when it was cold (ice) and 538 when it was warm (hand). This was fairly correct, but I did leave the ice on for longer
              when I was doing my demonstration so I got values more like 240.

            <h3><b>Videos of sensors interacting with the web page</b></h3>

            <p>
              I split my demonstration into four separate videos,
              because one video would be too long and too large of a file to upload.
              The videos are split: keyboard and LED, button sensor, thermoresistor warm, thermoresistor cold.
            </p>

            <p>
              When the button is pressed, the panda's ears and tie go from cheerful colors to
              icecream colors. Then when the thermoresistor gets warm, like when you put your warm
              fingers over it, the panda's nose goes from pink to red. When the thermoresistor becomes cold, like
              when you place an ice cube on it, the panda's nose goes from pink to darker shades of blues. Finally,
              when you press the 2 key on the laptop the LED turns on, and when you press the 1 key on the laptop
              the LED turns off.

            <br>
            <h3><b>Arduino Code </b></h3>
            <p>
              To get the sensors to change the Panda's colors on the web page,
              I coded the arduino to print out the sensor's values to the serial monitor so that I could retrieve those values
              and use in my javascript code. To get the 1 and 2 keys on a laptop keyboard to turn an LED on and off, I coded
              the arduino to read in serial data sent by the javascript code. This is the part where the web talks to the arduino.<br></br>

              First, I set up my constants; I set up the button's, thermoresistor's, and blue LED's pin number.
              In the set up I initalize the serial communcation so I can print the sensor values to the serial monitor and
              can retrieve serial communcation data from the javascript code.
              I also initalize the thermoresistor pin and button pin as an input and the LED as an output.
              Then in the loop, I read in the value of the button state (either High-1 or low-0) and assign it to a
              buttonValue, and I read in the thermoresistor's value (0 - 1023) and assign it to thermoValue.
              I can use analogRead() with the thermoresistor because it's in pin A0. Then I print the buttonValue and
              thermoValue to the serial monitor in the format [buttonValue, thermoValue]; it's in this format so the javascript
              can use JSON.parse to turn it into an array. This is so I can easily extract both sensor values in the javascript code.
              Then it checks if there's incoming serial data and if there is, it reads it in and assigns it to a variable. If the read in
              value is 49, it means that someone pressed the `1` key and it digitalWrites the blue LED to LOW, which turns it off. If the
              value is 48, it means that someone pressed the `2` key and it digitalWrites the blue LED to HIGH, which turns it on.
              Then it delays .3 seconds before looping again.

            <br>
            <h3><b>Javascript Code </b></h3>
            <p>
              I got the skeleton for this code from the hcde439-example3 sketch.js and then edited it to make it mine.

              The javascript code takes in and uses the information from the serial communication to affect the web page.
              The code first creates the variables needed for the serial communication and values for the sensors
              (button and thermoresistor). The setUp() initalizes the serial port for communication, creates the canvas,
              sets the canvas' background color, and sets the angle to be in degrees (this is needed because I rotate some shapes
              later on). The serialEvent() function reads in the line of data from the serial monitor (which is in [x, y] string form) and
              parses the JSON string into an array. Then it assigns the button and thermoresistor variables to the values from the data array.
              The function keyPressed() is always listening to see if a key on the keyboard is pressed. If a key is pressed it writes the
              pressed key's value to the serial so that the arduino code can use it.

              The function draw() draws the panda onto the web page and colors the panda
              based on the button and thermoresistor values. Finally, I have my helper methods that the draw() function calls in order to draw the
              panda. I did this because I needed each part of the panda to be a different color based on the sensors' values. The panda() function
              takes in an two RGB values and assigns it to the color of the inner and out panda ears. The bow() function also takes
              two RGB values and assigns it to the RGB colors of the bow tie. Finally, the drawNose() function takes in an R, G, and B value
              and assigns it to the RGB color of the nose.
