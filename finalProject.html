              Here are my ideas that I brainstormed. These ranged in difficulty and number of
              components. My first idea was to have an 'alert' system for your room. When someone
              comes walking toward your room, a glowing ball would alert you. My next idea was
              to use the joystick as a 'pen' on the LED screen; sort of like an etch a sketch.
              The next idea explored ways to spice up my diffuser. I thought it would be cool if
              the diffuser glowed different colors like the rainbow based on temperature or humidity.
              I could also set up the remote to be able to change the colors. My last idea was to create
              a 'prison' for your technology when you are studying and doing work. If you try and grab it,
              an alarm will go off and lights will blink red.

              Ultimately, I choose my <b>stuffed dog</b> idea. I really loved Build-A-Bears when I was younger
              and now after learning about circuits and sensors, I wanted to try and create my own
              handmade Build-A-Bear. This is also one of the more feasible ideas as I can use the photoresistor,
              motor, and LED lights and strip. Depending on time and ability I will choose a few of the features
              to implement for the stuffed dog.
